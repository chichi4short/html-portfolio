<hr>
<h3>Love in every word</h3>
<p>This move is about how Igbo men loves and appreciates their women. On the other hand, it describes how feminine a woman should appear to attract the best from her man. Odogwu in his show of love, bought the office complex where Chioma work just to collet her phone number, he calls her Achalaugo, Onye nwem and other sweet names. </p>
<h3>Momiwa</h3>
<p>This movie is about a gold digger who left her husband and  two little children whom she locked up in a room while the husband was away at work  in pursuit of greed with another man. A good Samaritan, Momiwa came into the lives of the man and the kids, helped them to come out of depression, nurtured them and helped them become a better person. </p>
