<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have first degree in Accounting, and my master’s in information systems management. When I came to United States, in the bid to survive and put food on the table for me and my kids, I worked at Walmart in the Produce, Meat and Deli department. Later I transitioned to the Pharmacy department where I worked as a Pharmacy Tech, while working at Walmart, I was not fulfilled with what I was doing, as I want to do more and go into IT.</p>

<p> I started boot camp training in Software testing where I did first project testing a Mortgage Bank Application. In the bid to build myself more, I started going to school to obtain my master’s in information systems management. After graduation, I got an internship job with Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) where built up my IT support experience and worked with the Database Administrator. I transitioned to Fulton position with Fulton County where I started off as a Service Desk Technician, and later got promoted to Information Systems Analyst II with Fulton County Superior Court. Currently, I am working with DeKalb County States and Magistrate Court as Special Project Coordinator Senior.</p>

<p>I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time. This led me to completing a Full Stack Development course with Great Learning in conjunction with Texas McCombs University. I completed this program but got little or nothing out of it. I was frustrated because I spent so much money, energy, and time into it.  I would not say the program coordinators did not try, but due to level of my no experience coding, I felt they should have done more to carry along those with no coding experience at least give them opportunity for refreshing/revision course with the next batch of students. I became excited when I dabbled into Dr. Angela’s Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp course in Udemy, with her simplicity in explaining every section, and now I am beginning to understand some of the codes. Currently, I am looking for new career opportunities my current job position cannot provide, where I can work as a coop in full stack development environment.</p>
